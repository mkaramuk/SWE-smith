#   repo         - for private repos (all of the above + private repo access)

# Custom SSH key for private repo operations (optional)
# If not set, the system looks for default keys in ~/.ssh/
# (id_rsa, id_ecdsa, id_ed25519, etc.)
#
# Set this only if your GitHub SSH key is at a non-standard path.
# GITHUB_USER_SSH_KEY=/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
